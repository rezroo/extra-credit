The content here represents material I share with students as questions come up in the class. I host these
for myself under trainer.edu.mirantis.com/reza because I explicitly tell students that Mirantis is not responsible
for this content, and if they have any future questions related to them, they have to come to me, not Mirantis
support/education.
