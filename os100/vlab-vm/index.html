</P>
Give the VM at least 6G of ram
</P>
Modify the VM to have at least 2 vcpu

</P>
<b>In VirtualBox Console File/Preferences select "Network", "Host-only Networks" tab, and make sure the hostonly interface you assigned to Adapter 1 has DHCP enabled.</b>

Power on and install openstack by login in as stack/b00tcamp, and executing:
</P>
./devstack/stack.sh
