<H1>How To Ping 8.8.8.8 From A VM</H1>
The way our vlab is setup, it will not route the ping from the VM to the internet. To fix that you must configure the vlab as a router.
</p>
Additionally, you must source NAT the outgoing packet so ping reply can reach the our vlab host. Without the NAT, the reply to ping cannot reach the VM.
<H2>Configure Your Controller As A Router</H2>
First, you may have to also enable ip-forwarding:
</p>
vi /etc/sysctl.conf
</p>
Uncomment "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1"
</p>
sysctl -p
</p>
<H2>Add An SNAT Rule</H2>
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
</p>
