Create a <b>Linux/Ubuntu(64-bit)</b> VM in virtualbox with:
</P>
2 vcpu
</P>
6G ram
</P>
3 NIC - in hostonly interface mode.
</P>
<b>Note:</b> You need 3 distinct hostonly interfaces. By default VB only has 1 hostonly interface defined. To create additional hostonly interfaces, using the VB Management Console, you can navigate to File/Preferences, select Network, select the "Host-only Networks" tab, and click the + button to create more networks. 
</P>
Use the downloaded image as the VM's boot disk.
